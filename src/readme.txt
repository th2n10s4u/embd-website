Returned nav and main inside a div container in app.js

Deleted the html.index because it was already created with create-react-app in the public folder
Duplicated images in figma to remove drop shadows and styles
Exported to folder on desktop and moved files to ./src/images/.. > had to use import {logo} from ../images for the file to be read

Attempted to implement material ui. It is very confusing to do the nav bar because it looks like the framework was made for apps as opposed to websites. 
Exported images from figma to the ^ images folder

TODO: 

Set a fixed width to a box around the form and text and center it. 



Look at material-ui documentation to see how navbar buttons are implemented 
    mui's navbar look like they're made for app development > web. 
    
Begin working on navbar by importing the image, creating the <nav> (buttons)
